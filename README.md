### Run control panel on deta.space ( recommended for less technical users )
- To get started on https://deta.space, a powerful web application building platform, the first step is to create an account on their website. Once you have successfully signed up and logged in, follow these steps to access the Teardroid v4 control panel app:
- In the same window, open the URL https://deta.space/discovery/r/yz9prb9jw7ku6atg. This link will take you to the HelloKitty app installation page.
- Click the "Install" button to begin the installation process. Wait for the installation to complete and then click on the "Canvas" button.
- You will be taken to the deta.space homepage. Click on the HelloKitty app, which can be found in your panel.
- Initially, the app will display pictures of cats. However, to access the app's login panel, simply add "/v4" to the end of the URL.

By following these steps, you will be able to take full advantage of deta.space's powerful web application building tools and access the HelloKitty app's login panel.
